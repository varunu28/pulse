/**
 * Per-thread retry-depth counter used by Pulse to detect retry amplification across services.
 *
 * <p>The depth is the count of retry attempts that contributed to the <em>current</em> in-flight
 * request, summed across the entire call chain. Two sources increment it:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Inbound: the {@link RetryDepthFilter} reads the {@code X-Pulse-Retry-Depth} header (or
 *       whatever {@code pulse.retry.header-name} is configured to) and seeds the local counter
 *       with the upstream's value.
 *   <li>Local: {@link RetryObservation} bumps the counter every time a Resilience4j {@code Retry}
 *       reports an attempt — so a service that retries N times raises the depth by N.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Outbound HTTP/Kafka propagation re-emits the current depth as a header so the next hop
 * inherits it. The result is a single integer that compounds through the call graph, which
 * Pulse compares against {@code pulse.retry.amplification-threshold} to detect cascades.
 *
 * <p>Static accessor mirrors {@link io.github.arun0009.pulse.guardrails.TimeoutBudget#current()}
 * so user code reads the depth without learning a new pattern.
